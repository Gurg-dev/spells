    <p class="fadein">Katapesh: The yellow-sailed ships from the Katapeshi city of Okeno are the most well-known and feared agents of the slave trade on the Inner Sea. Okeno originally
      began as a convenient spot for pirates to stop by to collect water and provisions without relying on the ports of the mainland nations. Keleshite Captain
      Xiren Bhey is the current leader of Okeno Slavers. He arrived in Okeno more than ten years ago and gained the reputation of a ruthless slaver. Captain Xiren
      Bhey (aka Stanley Pike) killed the leader of Okeno Slavers in a duel and established himself as the new leader. He captains the galley Undertow.

       until suddenly you hear the bottom of the ship screeching and after the crash upon some stones, the ship went over the rocky coral reef
        and rose on top of it. Your ship sank because the captain could no longer remember where the reefs were on the shore. The ship sank 
        next to a river mouth. Your ship must have been carrying resources because the flag had a gold coin on hand.  The beaches are also quite deep.
         The adventurers managed to get off the ship, alive. You swim ashore and watch as the ship continues to sink offshore...</p>

                  Ealdthryn is known as the deity of wisdom and knowledge. It is said that Ealdthryn's vast intellect
                  is matched only by their insatiable hunger for learning and understanding. Ealdthryn is often depicted as a wise old figure with a long white beard, deep-set
                  eyes, and a serene expression. They are typically depicted holding a staff or book, symbolizing their mastery over knowledge. According to legend, Ealdthryn
                  was one of the first beings to emerge from the void at the beginning of creation. As the universe took shape around them, Ealdthryn set about cataloging and
                  studying every aspect of it, from the movement of the stars to the behavior of the smallest subatomic particles. Ealdthryn's quest for knowledge was unquenchable,
                  and they spent countless eons traveling the cosmos, exploring every corner of it. Over time, Ealdthryn became revered by mortal beings for their vast knowledge
                  and wisdom. Temples were built in their honor, and they were worshipped by scholars, sages, and philosophers alike.<br> Ealdthryn was seen as a source of guidance
                  and inspiration, and their followers sought their counsel on matters of science, philosophy, and magic. Ealdthryn's teachings are focused on the importance
                  of learning and self-improvement.They believe that the pursuit of knowledge is a sacred duty, and that every being has the potential to grow and expand their
                  understanding of the universe. Ealdthryn's followers are encouraged to seek out new experiences, learn from their mistakes, and constantly strive to better
                  themselves. Despite their immense wisdom, Ealdthryn is not infallible.<br> There are many stories of Ealdthryn making mistakes or underestimating the power of
                  their own creations. However, these missteps are seen as learning opportunities, and Ealdthryn is always quick to rectify their errors and use them to expand
                  their understanding of the universe. In combat, Ealdthryn is rarely directly involved, preferring instead to use their vast intellect to outmaneuver and outwit
                  their opponents. Ealdthryn's followers are often powerful mages, using their knowledge of the arcane to manipulate reality itself and gain an edge in battle.
                  <br>Ealdthryn's enemies are those who seek to suppress knowledge and keep others in ignorance. They view such beings as threats to the natural order of the universe,
                  and will go to great lengths to thwart their plans. Ealdthryn's followers are also sworn enemies of any who seek to use knowledge for personal gain or to subjugate
                  others.
