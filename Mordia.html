                  Ealdthryn is known as the deity of wisdom and knowledge. It is said that Ealdthryn's vast intellect
                  is matched only by their insatiable hunger for learning and understanding. Ealdthryn is often depicted as a wise old figure with a long white beard, deep-set
                  eyes, and a serene expression. They are typically depicted holding a staff or book, symbolizing their mastery over knowledge. According to legend, Ealdthryn
                  was one of the first beings to emerge from the void at the beginning of creation. As the universe took shape around them, Ealdthryn set about cataloging and
                  studying every aspect of it, from the movement of the stars to the behavior of the smallest subatomic particles. Ealdthryn's quest for knowledge was unquenchable,
                  and they spent countless eons traveling the cosmos, exploring every corner of it. Over time, Ealdthryn became revered by mortal beings for their vast knowledge
                  and wisdom. Temples were built in their honor, and they were worshipped by scholars, sages, and philosophers alike.<br> Ealdthryn was seen as a source of guidance
                  and inspiration, and their followers sought their counsel on matters of science, philosophy, and magic. Ealdthryn's teachings are focused on the importance
                  of learning and self-improvement.They believe that the pursuit of knowledge is a sacred duty, and that every being has the potential to grow and expand their
                  understanding of the universe. Ealdthryn's followers are encouraged to seek out new experiences, learn from their mistakes, and constantly strive to better
                  themselves. Despite their immense wisdom, Ealdthryn is not infallible.<br> There are many stories of Ealdthryn making mistakes or underestimating the power of
                  their own creations. However, these missteps are seen as learning opportunities, and Ealdthryn is always quick to rectify their errors and use them to expand
                  their understanding of the universe. In combat, Ealdthryn is rarely directly involved, preferring instead to use their vast intellect to outmaneuver and outwit
                  their opponents. Ealdthryn's followers are often powerful mages, using their knowledge of the arcane to manipulate reality itself and gain an edge in battle.
                  <br>Ealdthryn's enemies are those who seek to suppress knowledge and keep others in ignorance. They view such beings as threats to the natural order of the universe,
                  and will go to great lengths to thwart their plans. Ealdthryn's followers are also sworn enemies of any who seek to use knowledge for personal gain or to subjugate
                  others.

          <h2><p id="Story" class="otsikko fadein">The campaign story so far...</p></h2>
          <p class="fadein"> The players have started with different tasks in the ranks of Red Mantis. they knew each other to some extent, Red Mantis has been operating in the city of Sutekh for about a year when Xalara arrived to establish it.
            Those from Sutekh know that about 3 years ago Bata took over the city from the previous leader when he executed him and his subjects in the attack. The influential people of the city then just accepted his leadership.<br /> Group of travelers came from the south enterance of Sutekh and they carried a mystery object in a cart. They were received by Bata and after they were observed by players from the Mantis guild to have received a flying ship and flew off to the sea.<br />
            <br />
            Mantis guild gave a mission to get some city council converted to their side. Mirielle d'Arc's husband Mark d'Arc got killed by the party to achieve this, the body is near a boatwreck at sea. After this the players went to Lady Elspeth von Carstein, after the players dealt with competing clothing business owner's shop, the lady agreed to side with Mantis' plan.  
            Mantis guild hired the players as double agents to find out what was happening on the mountain. The players found out about the tournament and won it against other competing parties at Fort Bata and Bata wanted to reward them with a protection mission on Mt. Hiro. A large portal had been built on the mountain, which the players noticed that it was activated after the players took the orb related to the conspiracy and put it among the other orbs. <br><br>
            The portal blew up at the mountain as the Mantis guild wanted, but problems arose when a wounded dragon appeared through the exploding portal, Bata called this dragon his mother. He spoke to his son and then left to rest, flying north.<br> 
         <br />
            The players took a fight on the mountain against Bata and they were so scared of the whole event and Bata's dragon form that they decided to run and jump down from the wall of the mountain temple and into the water. They barely survived the fall, and continued to the beach where they finally found each other.
            <br />
            The energy emanating from the portal triggered a chain reaction, causing the volcano to erupt and hot lava to rush towards the nearby city
            <br /><br />
             The rumble grew and grew, until the mountain exploded, spewing hot lava in all directions. The nearby city of Sutekh had never faced such a disaster. The ground shook as the lava flowed down the mountain slope towards the city. On the outskirts of the city, people ran for their lives, but many were not fast enough. The scorching heat and toxic gases made breathing difficult, or impossible.
             <br />
            The city's emergency services were overloaded, and the residents were left on their own. The elementalists tried their best to limit the flames, but it was a hopeless battle. The lava swallowed everything in its path, destroying homes, buildings and roads on the south side
            <br /><br />
            As the days passed, the lava began to cool, and the city began to assess the damage. The grief was deep and many had lost their homes and loved ones. The city suffered huge losses, but the residents decided to get up and start rebuilding. Although the mountain had caused a great catastrophe, most of the city survived in the end stronger than ever before.
            <br /><br /> The players conquered Sutekh with the help of the Holy Empire's battalions and navy, Bata was killed and the tyranny was over in the whole region. Anpu, the leader of the holy empire, appointed General Ki Juma as the interim leader of the Sand Kingdom region as it is being stabilized.</p></div>
